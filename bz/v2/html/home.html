<h2> About Me </h2>
<p>
When I graduated from high school, I heard about computer that is a machine which you can type with it instead of type writer and you can save database and information in 
its memory or over the floppy disk. It was so interesting for me to take those classes. I was so excited to type and work with computer in DOS environment. In that time, it was 
unbelievable for me that how computer works. I just took the computer operating courses and then I could pass the university exam for the program “Natural Resources, Fisheries”. 
Right after start my classes I got a part time job at a company as a front desk, it was a very good point for me that I was familiar with computer in that time.
</p>
<p>
After I graduated from university, I got a job at Tehran Channel 3 broadcasting that was a job not related to my bachelor but it was about computer. In the job description, 
they asked for having typing speed but I didn’t. In that time(1988), computer was very expensive and we couldn’t afford it then my sister and I decided to buy just a keyboard and 
she taught me how to practice typing because she had taken those courses. That was so funny because I did not have monitor to check my spelling, but it was ok, I could learn 
how to type fast enough for getting that job. 
</p>
<p>
I've learned a lot more about the computer in that work place. Then we heard about internet, WOW, what is that? Let’s go to explore internet. That was wonderful when we could contact 
with friends and relative in other countries over the internet using email or chat room. How cool it was. My sister and I was so much excited and decided to save our monthly 
income and can buy the computer. We already had keyboard, we bought monitor first and we bought case and mother board next month and the graphic card, etc. by next couple of 
months and started to assemble it. Wait a minute, we don’t have internet yet. We must pay for having internet. It was dial up one in those days (1993). We just got couple of 
kilobytes per day that just we could open emails for send and receive emails.   
</p>
<p>
I worked in different fields for nine years and my jobs was about working with computer, I really liked working with computer and I got good knowledge of hardware and software 
by the time. I wish I could go to get a degree in one of the computer programs in that time, but I didn’t because I was working full time and there was no online classes in those days. 
</p>
<p>
When I decided to come to U.S. they told me if you get civil/structural drafting certificate then you can get that job easily. I got my civil/structural drafting certificate 
and I worked as a drafter for two years here in Seattle and then they laid me off, it was the year of 2008 that economy was slow and structural companies was very slow. 
After that I researched about study in different field and some family and friend told me that go and get a degree in computer and if you see yourself successful then 
you can go for transfer to bachelor. 
</p>
<p>
I started to study at Edmonds Community College in winter 2016 and I see myself very successful. I will get my two years’ Associate Degree in <em>Web Application and Cloud Developement </em> by winter 2019.
